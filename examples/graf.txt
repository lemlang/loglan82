 The aim of the program was to show the possibility  to reuse
 the procedure Traverse twice in two different environments: 
 Stacks and Queues.

 Traverse+Stacks => Depth First Search 
 Traverse+Queues => Breadth First Search

 The restriction imposed was:
                   TO NOT DUPLICATE THE TEXT OF TRAVERSE!

AD.1 

 The static structure of the program:

 program GRAF;
  begin pref mouse block
  begin  pref IIUWGRAPH block
       (*  DECLARATIONS*)
       unit LISTE: class; end liste;
       unit STRUCTURE: class ; end STRUCTURE;
       unit QUEUES : STRUCTURE class; end QUEUES;
       unit STACKS : STRUCTURE class; end STACKS;
       unit BST : QUEUES procedure; end BST;
       unit DFS : STQCKS procedure; end DFS;
       unit GRAPH : class; 
           (* graph is represented as an 
              Array of LISTE *)
       end GRAPH;
       unit MENU : coroutine; end menu;
       begin (* main program *)
          (*CREATION of the menu-OPTIONS *)
          attach(main_menu)
      end
   end
 end GRAF; 


 AD 5.

 Type Menu is implemented as a coroutine which have as attributes
       (a) the list of possible options and
       (b) a sub_menu
 This imply that the different menus form an arbre; 
 It is fixed, in this implementation, that the first option is always 
 a step to the previous menu. 
 Menu was generated in the main program; The structure of it is as follows:


                      main menu

                 /           !
             graph        algorithms               help
              /                                    /  !   )
  clear  import  modify  create                next  prev  reset  
           /              !
      file  memory       add_node  add_arc  del_arc  save  print  getmap  



          algorithmes
         /        !

 Before executing the program make sure that an appropriate 
 driver was selected. 
 In order to do so execute a batch file
        exec
 (Do not forget to leave Norton Commander!)
 The ecran dimention is 640x480.

 The auxiliary files 
                       graf.txt
                       graf.dta
                       graf1.dta etc
 are supposed to be in c:/loglan95/   
 This can be obiously changed bz programer (in the text of the program).
     
 The  is supposed to be QWERTZ.
